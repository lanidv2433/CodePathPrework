## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

Tik Tok:
1) Unlimited scrolling
2) Able to post any type of content

Spotify:
1) Able to customize profile (playlist themes)
2) Their music AI that recommends new songs curated to your taste

Instagram:
1) Switching through multiple different accounts easily
2) Being able to like user stories

My app:
I would like to make a music social media type app. I want to implement the features where users will be able to customize their own profile by being able to pin their favorite songs, be able to post snippets of their favorite songs, have an unlimited scroll feature where users can discover new songs through recommended and through their following's posts, and also be able to see what their friends are currently listening and be able to react to the songs.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I was confused by some of the wording in the instructions, but once I re-read it and understood, I had no other problems.
